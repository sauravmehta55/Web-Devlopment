             Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and 
             science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space 
             Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military 
             missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the 
             development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal 
             organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
